Learning the different type of fonts.

In this File I've tried bunch of the fonts while learning about it such as serif fonts, sans-serif fonts, Monospace fonts, cursive fonts, Fantasy fonts.

There were some fonts that were not correctly installed so the effects is not shown.

I learned the Differences about these fonts, If you want to do the same- You can visit this link - https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_font.asp

Please don't judge it, I'm still new ;).
